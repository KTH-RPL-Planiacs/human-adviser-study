    <h1>Instructions</h1>
    <p style="border-width:3px; border-style:solid; border-color:#FF0000; padding: 1em;"><strong>Please make sure to
            read the instructions before starting the study and answering the questions.
            <br> Note down the participant ID given to you after finishing the external study.</strong></p>

    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>In this study, you are tasked to play a small game in which you assemble hamburgers together with your
        robotic co-worker. In order to do that, both you and the robot individually collect ingredients. Once
        you have collected all ingredients, you have to deliver the burger. This process is repeated to produce
        as many burgers as possible until the time runs out.</p>
    <p>For safety reasons, you and the robot should not reach into the same ingredient tray at the same time.
        Sometimes, the robot might need help with picking up ingredients. The robot will coordinate with you by
        giving clues.</p>

    <h3>Play Area</h3>
    <p>You are represented by the human face on the top, the robot is represented by the robotic face. The play
        area is divided into squares and you can move between them. In the middle row, five ingredient trays
        are placed, from which you can pick up the necessary ingredients to assemble a burger.</p>

    <h3>Timer and Burger Count</h3>
    <p>On the right of the screen is the timer and the assembled burger counter. Once the timer reaches zero,
        the time is up and the game is finished. The assembled burger counter keeps track on how many burgers
        you and the robot assembled. The game lasts a total of three minutes.</p>

    <h3>Inventory</h3>
    <p>Both you and the robot gather ingredients. The inventory on the left of the screen shows which
        ingredients you have already collected. Collected ingredients are coloured, ingredients that have to
        still be picked up are greyed out. The robot has a seperate inventory, as it assembles burgers
        independently.</p>

    <h3>Movement</h3>
    <p>You move your character up, down, left and right with the arrow keys on your keyboard. Every time you
        move, the robot also moves. You can also press the space bar to wait a turn and let the robot move.</p>

    <h3>Fetching Ingredients</h3>
    <p>If you move down into an ingredient tray, you interact with the tray and collect the ingredient.</p>

    <h3>Delivery</h3>
    <p>If you move left into the square with the plate, you attempt to deliver the burger. If you collected all
        ingredients, the burger count increases by one and your inventory is emptied. A red arrow appears on top
        of the plate if you are ready to deliver a burger.</p>

    <h3>Advice from the Robot</h3>
    <p>During the game, the robot can utter advice to help coordinate your actions. If you violate safety rules, the
        game will reset. This does not reset your burger count. When a black arrow is shown, the robot wants you to move
        or interact in that direction.</p>
